#data

; The following code sequence tests checks the amount of time required
; to load word variables from even and odd addresses.
;
; Note that this code assumes that IBM/L inserts all user variables
; at the beginning of the data segment.  If you modify the sources
; to IBMLINC.A and insert stuff before the marker, this code may
; not work properly.
;
; The three bytes between I and J make sure that J's address is at
; an address where (adrs mod 4) = 3 to guarantee slow performance
; on a 386/486.

I		dw	?	;Variable at even address
		db	0,0,0
J		dw	?	;Variable at odd address.
